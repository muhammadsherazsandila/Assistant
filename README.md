A lightweight, extensible Python assistant framework for building conversational agents, automations, and integrations. This repository provides the core structure, utilities, and examples to help you create and extend an "Assistant" application powered by Python.

> Note: This README is intentionally generic ‚Äî adapt the examples, commands, and configuration sections to match the actual code and entry points in this repository.

## Features

- Simple core for handling user requests and producing responses
- Modular structure to add skills, plugins, or integrations
- Utilities for configuration, logging, and testing
- Example usage and quick-start guide

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (recommend using the latest 3.x)
- pip (for installing dependencies)
- Optional: virtualenv, poetry, or pipenv for isolated environments

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammadsherazsandila/Assistant.git
cd Assistant
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Create .env file in root directory
```bash
PORCUPINE_KEY = ""
WAKE_WORD = ""
```
5. Get Access Key from Picovoice
   Go to üëâ https://console.picovoice.ai
   - Sign up (free).
   - Copy your Access Key (you‚Äôll need it in the code).
   - You can use built-in keywords like ‚Äújarvis‚Äù, ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù, etc. or create a custom one.
  
6. Install dev requirements (linters, formatters):

```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```
7. Run the assistant in development mode:

```bash
# If there's a CLI entry point
python -m src.main
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/my-feature
3. Make your changes and add tests
4. Run tests and linters
5. Open a pull request describing your changes

Please follow the repository's code style and commit message conventions (if any).

## Roadmap ideas

- Add more example skills and integrations (e.g., Slack, Telegram)
- Add a web UI or API wrapper
- Add async support for high throughput use cases
- Provide packaged releases (pip / PyPI)
- You can run this as a background services by creating .bat file and shortcut for startup

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter dependency issues, recreate the virtual environment and reinstall:
  - rm -rf .venv && python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
